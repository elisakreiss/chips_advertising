# Open questions

- generally, very little research in Germany on the language of advertisement and authenticity... and much more
- **determining the price threshold**: I canâ€™t find any research to this at all - what do people rather focus on when choosing a product: price (total price) or price per weight (relative price)? Can we do a quick MTurk study or short questionnaire session here?

### Non-semantic analysis
- total word count and the problem of translations
- sentence complexity
	- average word length:
		- no difference
		- "bell pepper flavor" becomes "Paprikageschmack" -> "Paprikageschmack" is neither more difficult to understand nor less frequent than non-compounded structures like "Geschmack von/der Paprika" (splitting up a compound into a more complex syntactic structure is rather considered more intellectual... but evidence for this claim is hard to find)
		- what can be found though is "Paprika-Geschmack" and other versions to make it more readable
	- sentence length:
		- in original study, they used Flesch-Kincaid readability (FKR) test
		- FKR relies on syllable counting -> very difficult to get in German
		- but even Coleman-Liau readability (CLR) test is not very useful in German, since it also incorporates average word length (see problems above)
		- results of CLR comparing expensive and inexpensive chips are basically identical -- but one sees a slight difference (tendency) in the CLR_S (sentences per 100 words) component towards longer sentences for more expensive chips
	- word frequency:
		- similar to word length problem
		- see example in HTML
	- the only good way to solve this (if we don't want to accept that this just can't be satisfactorily analyzed), then we need to find a way of splitting compound nouns, right? But this also can lead into trouble when extracting frequencies from corpora -- there is some literature here, but it will be a big project! 

### Semantic analysis
- general problem with categorization (see open\_categorization\_issues.txt)
- possible explanations for less "comparative phrases": Laws in Germany that statements like this need to be objectively tested and true. It also may not disparage or diminish competitors.
